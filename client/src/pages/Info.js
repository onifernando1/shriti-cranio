          Biodynamic Craniosacral Therapy (BCST) is a profound body treatment
          which involves a light touch.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is gentle and non-intrusive such that it can be used on all,
          including newborns, the elderly and pregnant women past their first
          trimester.
        </p>
        <p>
          From birth, any stresses, strains and trauma that life throws at us
          are stored in our bodies, a record of past experiences. For some,
          these past events may then present themselves later on as physical
          symptoms, such as backache, migraine or gut problems. In addition,
          others may display feelings of depression and anxiety.
        </p>
        <p>
          BCST has its roots in osteopathy and developed from the research done
          by the American osteopath, Dr William Sutherland in the early 1900s.
          He discovered rhythmic movements in and around the bones in the head
          and body. His observations led him to realise that there was a direct
          correlation between the restriction of this movement and physical,
          mental and emotional ill -health and for the body's ability to self-
          heal. It is these movements and restrictions that are felt in CST and
          as these restrictions dissipate, health, wellbeing and balance are
          restored.
        </p>
        <p>
          ​ Working together with the body's natural ability to self- repair,
          BCST enables the client to access the underlying health that is
          present in all of us and facilitates the letting go of these held
          patterns.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a typical BCST session, you would lie fully clothed on a treatment
          couch and I would gently place my hands on your body. The treatment
          lasts for about one hour.
